# ProjectPlanetary - Planetary Programming Language

## Overview

**Planetary** (CodeName: ProjectPlanetary) is a new programming language that mirrors the structure of our universe. This language is designed to be intuitive and reflective of the natural hierarchy seen in the cosmos—from atoms to planets, from systems to universes.

The goal of **Planetary** is to break down complex programming concepts into a natural, understandable syntax that mimics how the universe operates. Whether you're dealing with atoms (tokens) or entire universes (programs), Planetary aims to create an immersive coding experience that is as elegant as the cosmos itself.

Please note: **Planetary is still in the early stages of development and is a heavy work in progress (WIP)**. Many features are still being designed and refined. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we continue to build and shape this cosmic language.

## Language Hierarchy

1. **Atom** (Token)  
   The smallest building block of a Planetary program, similar to characters or symbols in other languages.
   
2. **Compound** (Line)  
   A logical grouping of atoms and molecules to create a meaningful instruction, analogous to a line of code.
   
3. **Planet** (Function)  
   A collection of compounds working together to perform a specific task, akin to a function or method in traditional languages.
   
4. **System** (File)  
   A grouping of planets (functions), which together define a complete module or file.
   
5. **Universe** (Program)  
   The entirety of your system, representing a complete executable program.

## Features

- **Cosmic Syntax**  
  Planetary’s syntax is built to reflect the natural organization of the universe, making it easier for developers to reason about their code in hierarchical terms.

- **Efficiency and Readability**  
  Code in Planetary is written to be efficient and clear. You’ll be able to see the “cosmic flow” of the program at a glance.

- **Modularity and Scalability**  
  Planets can interact seamlessly within systems and universes, allowing for powerful modularity and scalability in your programs.
